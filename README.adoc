= Microprofile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

* `microservice-schedule` : Schedule of the conference
* `microservice-session` : Sessions of the conference
* `microservice-speaker` : Speakers of the conference
* `microservice-vote` : Votes for each session
* `web-application` : Frontend Angular2 | Bootstrap4

The WebApp is a direct subscriber to the individual Microservices.
This means that there is no aggregator / middle-man application.
The WebApp itself provides a known relative EndPoint microservice that enables the lookup of
URLs to the other services.

== Technologies

* Java
* Micro Profile
* JAX-RS 2.0 / JSON-P 1.0 / CDI 1.1

== Quickstart - Run all services and UI in separate runtimes

This will run each service in the runtime container that its setup for and the UI in a Node.js server to interact with them.

Build, package and run all services and the UI:

----
mvn clean package -Pstart
----

Run all services and the UI:

----
mvn package -Pstart -pl :microservice-start
----

== Development Build

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Build the projects using Maven (`mvn clean install`) or (`mvn -fn clean install`) to skip over failed tests.
* To get the technical documentation, just `mvn clean generate-resources` under the `docs` directory.
You will find a PDF and HTML version of the documentation under `docs/target/generated-docs`

== Development Tests

mvn clean test

== Run Individual Services

Each service can run on any container (this is the Microprofile guarantee),
but the service projects have been written by vendors to use their container.

The following sections describe vendor specifics:

=== microservice-schedule
The Schedule service is provided using a special microprofile release of link:http://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro] which can be downloaded from link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22payara-microprofile%22[Maven Central]

*Build and run the service*
When building the service Payara Microprofile packages both the war file and the microprofile runtime into a single UberJar for convenience.
```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
```

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice will bind to port 8080, if this is not available it will bind to the next available port e.g. 8081. To specify the port use --port as a command line option

Click on link:http://localhost:8080/microservice-schedule/schedule/1[http://localhost:8080/microservice-schedule/schedule/1]

To see a full set options run the jar with the --help command line option or see the link:https://payara.gitbooks.io/payara-server/content/documentation/payara-micro/payara-micro.html[Payara Micro Documentation] for a full list of options.

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.liberty.jar
```


=== microservice-session

Provided using link:http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-session
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-session-swarm.jar [-D<OPTION>]
```

*Address & Port Bindings*

.Session Service Options
|===
|Flag |Description| Default

| swarm.bind.address=<address>
| Interface to bind servers
| 0.0.0.0

| swarm.http.port=<port>
| Sets the port for the HTTP server
| 8080

| swarm.port.offset=<offset>
| Sets a global port adjustment
| 0
|===

For a full set of configuration options please see link:https://wildfly-swarm.gitbooks.io/wildfly-swarm-users-guide/content/[the Wildfly Swarm Userguide]

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-session
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar target/microservice-session.liberty.jar
```

=== microservice-speaker
Provided using link:http://tomee.apache.org/[Apache TomEE 7.x]

*Build and run the service*
[source,sh]
----
cd microservice-speaker

cd microservice-speaker-web

mvn clean package tomee:exec -DskipTests

java -DadditionalSystemProperties="-Dport.http=9191 -Dport.ajp=9292 -Dport.shutdown=9393" -jar target/microservice-speaker-web-exec.jar
----

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-speaker
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar microservice-speaker-web/target/microservice-speaker.liberty.jar
```


=== microservice-vote
Provided using link:https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/[WebSphere Liberty]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-vote
mvn clean install
java -jar target/microprofile-vote.jar
```

Access the app at link:http://localhost:7070/vote[http://localhost:7070/vote].

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice will start on port 7070. To set it to a different port use the following Maven properties:
```
-DtestServerHttpPort=9080 -DtestServerHttpsPort=9443
```

=== Web Application (UI)

This starts the UI app and all services running in an embedded container.
The landing page is http://localhost:8080

.Console 1
----
mvn clean package tomee:run -pl :web-application -DskipTests
----

This starts a gulp task that monitors and updates changes to the static resources.

.Console 2
----
$ cd web-application
$ mvn frontend:gulp
----

Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----
